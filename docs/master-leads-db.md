# Master Leads DB — Connector Guide

The Master Leads DB is the lead-intelligence layer behind this skill. Two editions:

1. **Hosted connector (Ecom North team)** — runs in the cloud, nothing to install; connect your claude.ai account once and the tools appear in every Claude Code session. Covered below.
2. **Self-hosted community edition (everyone else)** — open source, bring your own Apollo/StoreLeads/Emailable API keys, data stays in a local SQLite file: **https://github.com/ecomnorthteam/master-leads-db-mcp**. Install instructions live in that repo's README; the tool surface matches what this skill expects.

## Getting access (hosted edition)

1. Ask your team admin to share the Master Leads DB connector with your claude.ai account / the Ecom North workspace.
2. In **claude.ai → Settings → Connectors**, the connector appears as **"Master Leads DB"**. Add/enable it.
3. First use triggers a sign-in (OAuth). Use your Ecom North account.
4. Verify: in Claude Code, ask "check the daily lead budget" — you should get a spend-vs-cap answer, not an error.

## What's inside (what your pulls are actually using)

| Capability | Tools (prefix `Master Leads DB`) | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Store discovery — 4M+ real online stores searchable by platform/country/revenue/category | `storeleads_search_domains`, `storeleads_bulk_get_domains`, … | **Free** (team subscription) |
| Company discovery — Apollo's 30M+ company DB | `apollo_search_companies` | $0.05/result |
| Find founders/CEOs at companies | `find_decision_makers` (free, our DB) → `apollo_find_decision_makers` (paid fill) | free / credits |
| Email verification | `emailable_verify_emails` | ~$0.001/email |
| Shared outreach history — team-wide "who did we already contact" | `check_outreach_history`, `log_outreach` | free |
| ICP scoring vs winner cohorts | `score_icp_fit` | free |
| Budget guardrails | `get_daily_budget_status`, `get_credit_burn` | free |

Everything found is automatically saved into our shared master database, so each pull makes the next one faster and cheaper.

## House rules

- **Always log outreach.** The ecn-outreach skill does this automatically (`log_outreach` after enrolling leads in GetSales). If you push leads to any sending tool manually, log it — otherwise teammates will re-contact the same brands.
- **Don't bulk-reveal Apollo emails casually** — each reveal costs credits. The skill asks before paid steps; keep that habit in manual use.
- Budget caps are enforced server-side per day. If a run stops with a budget message, that's the guardrail working — talk to your team admin to raise it.

## Field-tested API quirks (for anyone using the tools manually)

These are already baked into the ecn-outreach skill — listed here for manual/advanced use:

1. `storeleads_search_domains`: store domain is returned in the **`name`** field; `estimated_sales_yearly` is **annual USD**; the built-in revenue min/max filters mis-handle units — filter revenue yourself from raw values; there is no city filter — filter on the returned `city`.
2. `storeleads_search_domains` with a `fields` projection **does not save results to the master DB** (rows skip as `invalid_brand_domain`). Re-fetch keepers without `fields` if you want them persisted.
3. `storeleads_bulk_get_domains` default response is enormous — always pass a `fields` list.
4. `apollo_search_companies`: the revenue min/max arguments do **not** narrow the Apollo search itself (you pay for noise) — constrain with `employee_ranges` and `technologies` instead; `keyword_tags` alone is dangerously loose.
5. `find_decision_makers`: report counts from `total_matching`, not `returned`; `would_yield_if_filters_relaxed` tells you what loosening filters would add.
